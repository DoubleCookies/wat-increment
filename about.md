## About
How do you usually increment your JS variable? Probably like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
let a = 0;
a++;
++a;
a = a + 1;
{% endhighlight %}

It's absolutely correct!

**And boring.**

That's why I decided to find most weird/strange/etc. ways to increment variable in JS. 
You can always try this at home, **but not on work**. This is absolutely bad idea to use 
those code snippets in production.
