## You know the rules...
Actually you don't know them except you read it before. So...

- Code should increment variable. If we have `a = 0`, next iteration should return 1, after that - 2, 3, 4...
- It should be weird/strange/etc. Just imagine *normal* code with ***your*** example. 
If you wanna throw your PC/laptop/tablet in window — you are doing great!
- No imports for your code. It should be *pure* JS.
    - The Easiest way to test if it works — browser console.
- Supposed every code has string like `a = 0` before it. It's okay to put it in your code
    - The variable name by default is **'a'**. You can use a different name for styling purposes.

So, now we can finally say

## You know the rules and so do I!
