*Back to `a` variable*. Also this time there is a lot of text:

{% highlight javascript %}
let a = 0;

a = a - "Strings can help to increment our variable with this number:".indexOf('1') // a = 1
{% endhighlight %}

### Explanation
This one doesn't have tricky JS code. We just try to find index of `1` in string, but it will return `-1`
because this substring isn't present. After that simple math helps us to increment variable.
