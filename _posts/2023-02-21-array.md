Small example with array

{% highlight javascript %}
let a = 0;

a+=+!![]; // a = 1
{% endhighlight %}

### Explanation
- In the beginning we do some *boolean* things with array. Empty array *isn't false*, so `![]` will return `false` and 
`!![]` will return `true`
- And that's it - on next step we just sum `true` to our variable, and `true` is *equal* to `1`
